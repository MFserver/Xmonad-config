# Xmonad-config

This is my basic Xmonad configuration. It features 11 named workspaces operated by one hand on a normal QWERTY keyboard using Caps lock as a switcher, is lightning-fast, pretty intuitive and quick-starts applications using keyboard commands. I've found it to be quite versatile. 

## Requirements

xmonad (obviously)
xmobar
stalonetray (gives icons)
conky
dmenu (for starting applications) (might be optional depending on your definition of 'optional')

### Optional

Chromium (the web browser)
Dolphin (my file manager of choice)
Xterm (terminal)
Pulseaudio
scrot (screenshots)
Kate (text editor for code files and such)

Some other applications have support in my config but are by no means required to run it. Like, for example, League of Legends.
